This tutorial is to get you started for git. As a contributor you will need to be well versed with forks, branches,remotes, fetch, push,pull, add and commit.

1.
Download git. https://git-scm.com/downloads
Git is different from github, you can read that from elsewhere, but you'll be using the git software to interact with github.

2.
Fork a repository.
This can be done through the website, go to https://github.com/ACM-XLabs/canteen-controller and click the form button. A copy of the repository will be created in your github account (https://github.com/<yourusername>/canteen-controller).

3.
Learn about git.
The git website holds the best git tutorial and docs, learning how to work with git is priceless, no matter where you end up working in the future as a computer engineer. 
https://git-scm.com/doc

4.
Since the docs are very extensive, to begin we'll go thorugh the steps of making a small commit.
To access git, you can right click and select "Open git bash"
Before using git, you might have to set it up. Follow the steps here : https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup

5.
Now, to make a local copy of your repository that you forked, go to your desired location on your machine, then right click and open git bash.
After that, clone the repository through the command :
https://github.com/<yourusername>/canteen-controller

6.
You will now have the entire repository in your local machine.
For our initial commit, open the tutorial folder, make a new text file with your name as the file name and inside write about your current android qualifications.

7.
Next, through git bash run the command : 
git remote -v
This will show you all your remote repository if any. If you have a repository named master with the url as (https://github.com/<yourusername>/canteen-controller), continue
else, run the command:
git remote add origin https://github.com/<yourusername>/canteen-controller

---------------------------------------------------------

a. By the time you do this, the main repository will have changed by then, so you need to fetch the new content from their. For that, follow the following steps:

a1. Create a remote for the main repositories 
git remote add main https://github.com/ACM-XLabs/canteen-controller

a2. Fetch the results
git fetch main master

a3. Merge it with your current repo 
(This is where stuff usually goes wrong! Merge conflicts have to be manually resolved, we'll look at it later, since you're creating individual files, this shouldn't cause a problem yet)
git merge main/master

a4.Update your repo online
git push origin master
---------------------------------------------------------


8.
Next, add the changes you made (creating the new file) for staging through:
git add --all
You can run the command 
git status
for knowing the current state of your local repo.

9.
After adding, commit the changes through
git commit -m "<Enter commit message here>"
Writing the commit message is extrememly important, to tell us what changes you have made. Make sure to keep it only a few words long but still be descrptive. For example "created text file Kushagra.txt"

10.
Now, push your changes online
git push origin master
this will ask for your github username and password and then you can check online at https://github.com/<yourusername>/canteen-controller for the changes

11.
To merge these changes with the original repository at https://github.com/ACM-XLabs/canteen-controller you need to generate a pull request.
That can be done thorugh the website by simply clicking the pull request button.

12.
At any point if you go wrong and things aren't working, you might have to delete your entire local folder and start again from cloning; this almost always happen when you first start. (And even when you're really good at it :P)
